# SmartPlantPanel™


## intro
SmartPlantPanel is a simple plant database that allows plant parents to look at every info they need to take care of their plants.

Users can watch all the available plants and save them in a nursery to easilly read everything they need.

SmartPlantPanel™ offers 3 account types:
|          |
|----------|
|No Account|
|User      |
|Admin     |

Each account has access to different functionalities; continue reading to know more!



## Pages
The main pages are the 'Homepage' and 'My Nursery'.


### Home
'Homepage' displays all the available plants; each plant has a '👁️' button that allows to open the detail page of the plant, from which you can add
any plant to your nursery.

Full access to Homepage is granted for every account type!


### My Nursery
Here's where things get interesting.

Do you remember the plants you added from the Homepage? Here you can look at them without having to search in the whole database!

By clicking on the '👁️' icon of a plant you can see a pop-up displaying all the plant details and a button that, when clicked, will remove the plant to your nursery.

Here what each account type can do:
|Account   |Permissions|
|:---------|:---|
|No Account|Store and remove plants saved in the current session|
|User      |Store and remove plants saved in current and previous sessions|
|Admin     |Store and remove plants saved in current and previous sessions|


### Login
This is the plain old login page.

If you don't already have an account, you just need to click on 'Create an account' to create a personal nursery that you can access anywhere at any time you want.


### 404
We all know what 404 means, but in case you don't, just know that you're trying to reach something that is not there 😉.

Don't worry: just click on the only button you can click on and you will go back to the HomePage.


## Restricted area
You decided that you are too great of a plant parent to take care only of your plants? Welcome in the SmartPlantPanel team!

If you managed to become an admin, on your first login you will notice the navbar looks a little different: you've unlocked the 'Admin' page.

From here you can use the dropdown to navigate through 3 pages:
- Add a plant
- Manage plants
- Manage users


### Add a plant
This simple form allows you to add a new plant to our database.

Unfortunately the database itself is a mock Json db, so images can't actually be uploaded from there.
